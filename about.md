**Ashish Bisht** is a PhD researcher in the Astro-particle physics group at the Univeristy of Trento, Italy. After graduating from the University of Delhi with a bachelors in Physics Honours, he joined the Indian Institute of Technology Indore (India), to pursue Master's in Nuclear and Particle physics. During the Master's program he studied the event shape observables in the *pp* collisions at the LHC. During the same period he got an internship with Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology Indore, house to the largest Synchrotron (*INDUS-2*) in India. While working closely with the beamlines and highly advanced laser lab he got inspired by the technology being used to fuel particle physics at the big Accelerators. Currently his work is focused on the development of low gain avalanche detectors for astro-particle physics experiments at the University of Trento, Italy. His current research interests are particle physics and silicon detectors for particle physics.

In my spare time I like to hike mountains and play Table-Tennis and Chess.
